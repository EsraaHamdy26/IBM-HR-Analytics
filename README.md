  - `seaborn`
- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Colab Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation

## Dataset

- Dataset: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- Size: ~1,471 rows Ã— 35 columns

## Key Objectives

- Encode categorical variables
- Create new features if necessary

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Analyze correlations between features
- Visualize key patterns using bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, etc.
- Highlight factors that contribute to high attrition rates

### 3. Data Visualization (Tableau)
- Build interactive dashboards to display:
  - Attrition by age, gender, and department
  - Job satisfaction and environment satisfaction scores
  - Monthly income vs. job role
  - Overtime and its relationship to attrition

### 4. Insights & Recommendations
- Summarize key findings
